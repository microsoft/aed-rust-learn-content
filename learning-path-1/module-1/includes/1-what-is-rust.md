# 2. What is Rust?

Rust is an open source systems programming language that helps you write faster, more reliable
software. Rust offers control over low-level details (such as memory usage) in combination with
high-level ergonomics (such as iteration and interfaces), eliminating the hassle traditionally
associated with low-level languages.

Rustâ€™s modern, flexible type system and the novel borrow checker ensures your program is free of
null pointer dereferences, double frees, dangling pointers, and similar bugs, all at compile time,
without runtime overhead.

In multi-threaded code, Rust catches data races at compile time, making concurrency much easier to
use.
