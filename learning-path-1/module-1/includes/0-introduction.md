## What's the best way to learn Rust?

By far, the best way to learn Rust is to practice writing code as much code as possible. So, we
encourage you to type along with the exercises in this module and the others in this learning path.

Furthermore, you need to begin learning small foundational concepts and build on them with continual
practice and exploration. You’ll build a few projects along the way, and by the end, you’ll have a
solid grasp of the language.


## Learning Objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

-   How to setup your development environment for using Rust.
-   How to write a simple "Hello, World!" program.
-   How to use Cargo, Rust’s powerful package manager and build system.


## Prerequisites

-   None
