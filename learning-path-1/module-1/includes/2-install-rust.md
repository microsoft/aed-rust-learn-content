# 3. Install Rust

The recommended way to install Rust is to use `rustup`, the Rust Toolchain Installer. Go to
<https://rustup.rs> to find the appropriate instructions for your operating system.

Rust has a **6-week rapid release process** and supports a great number of platforms, so there are many
builds of Rust available at any time. So, if you've installed `rustup` in the past, you can update
your installation by running the command `rustup update`.

After you’ve completed the installation, you should have the `rustc` and `cargo` commands available at your command line:

    $ rustc --version
    rustc 1.47.0 (18bf6b4f0 2020-10-07)

    $ cargo --version
    cargo 1.47.0 (f3c7e066a 2020-08-28)

You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date for the latest stable version that
has been released in the following format:

`rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)`

If you see this information, you have installed Rust successfully! If you don’t see this information
and you’re on Windows, check that Rust is in your `%PATH%` system variable.
